## Blood Pressure Measuring Project





## Key Features:

1. Efficient Data Entry: With my user-friendly interface, you can easily input patient data, including patient ID, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

2. Accurate Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) Calculation: The Patient Record Processor automatically calculates the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) for each patient. This critical metric provides valuable insights into a patient's cardiovascular health.

3. Customizable:  Whether you're managing a handful of patients or an extensive list, My program adapts to your needs. Input the number of patient records you want to process, and let the Patient Record Processor take care of the rest.

4. Clear Results:  Get instant access to patient-specific results. The program displays patient IDs alongside their calculated MAP values, allowing you to quickly review and assess patient health.

## How It Works:

1. Input the Number of Records: Specify the number of patient records you'll be working with. This ensures the program tailors its processing to your needs.

2. Enter Patient Data: Enter patient IDs, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using the simple prompts. My system ensures accurate data entry, critical for precise MAP calculations.

3. Instant MAP Calculation: My program handles the complex task of MAP calculation behind the scenes. With just a click, you'll have accurate MAP values ready for each patient.

4. Review and Analyze:The Patient Record Processor presents a clear overview, including patient IDs and their corresponding MAP values. This information is invaluable for making informed healthcare decisions.
