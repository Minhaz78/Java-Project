# Disaster Response System (DRS)(Running Project)
## Technology: Java, JUnit, JavaFX Scene Builder, MySQL Database Server
-  In this project, designed and developed a system to coordinate disaster response activities such as evacuation, search and rescue, and infrastructure restoration across multiple departments.
-  Created a user-friendly interface using JavaFX Scene Builder to allow users to report disasters (e.g., hurricanes, fires, earthquakes) and ensure quick and efficient responses.
- Implemented back-end logic using Java to assess and prioritize reported disasters based on severity, ensuring the most critical situations receive immediate attention.
- Integrated a MySQL database server to store and manage disaster reports, actions, and communications between departments, improving data accessibility and coordination.
- Conducted JUnit testing to ensure the functionality and reliability of key system components, enhancing the systemâ€™s overall performance and response efficiency.
