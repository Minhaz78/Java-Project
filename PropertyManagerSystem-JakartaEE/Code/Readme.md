# Overview

This paper contains detailed instructions for developing, implementing, and utilising the Secured Property Management system. The system is a three-tier enterprise application built with Jakarta EE technologies and hosted on a GlassFish server. MySQL serves as the database for persistent storage. This system manages properties (for sale and rent), property managers, and assigns properties to managers. It also provides features like user registration, login, and account recovery, which ensure secure access to system capabilities.
